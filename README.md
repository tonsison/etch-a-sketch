# etch-a-sketch

The program makes use of DOM Manipulation in JavaScript in order to emulate a sketch toy using the mouse.

The webpage detects the mouse hovering and displays a black background after.

DOM Manipulation was used in order to create the grids with the use of divs. It was also utilized in creating the button that deletes the previous grid and displays a new one. CSS was added in order to properly center and allocate consistent space.
